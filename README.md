## Description 
This is a simple blog showing articles displayed in mosaic layout. Here's a [live url](https://kisi-mosaic.onrender.com).

## Development
The Nuxt web application and the Node Express Server coexist in this repository. the Node Express server code is located in the `/backend` directory.

- The only environment variable required is `WEB_URL`.it points to the url of the web app. an example is included in the `.env.example` file.

- running `npm run dev` locally starts the server on port `4000` and the Nuxt app on port `3000`, exposing the app to you at `http://localhost:3000`
